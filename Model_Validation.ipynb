      "Suppose we have built a machine learning model, based on any of supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. After building a model based on some algorithms, the next natural thing to do would be to check how well it is doing. The answer to how well it is doing depends on what *metric* is being used to measure the performance on what *dataset*. Evaluating your model based on various relevant metrics and datasets is called model validation.\n",

      "###Evaluation Metrics\n",

      "[Accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision) is often the starting point for analyzing the quality of a predictive model, as well as an obvious criterion for prediction. However, it is not the only metric or criterion to evaluate a model, as we'll see below.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Limitations\n",
      "There are several problems with using accuracy as a key metric. For one, it is totally possible to come up with a model that is completely useless and has zero predictive power, yet it has higher accuracy. This is known as the [Accuracy Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_paradox). Second would be the problem of [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting). While we are building our model, if we are blindly targeting accuracy, it would easily result in overfitting. Such a model would again be useless as it would not perform well on unseen or new data. A third scenario comes up when the data you is highly skewed. In such cases, a high accuracy is bound to be achieved and it does not reflect anything on the quality of the model."

      "Sensitivity is a measure of how well *false negatives* are being avoided and similarly, specificity is a measure of how well *false positives* are avoided. An ideal model would be one that has $100\\%$ *sensitivity* as well as $100\\%$ *specificity*. However, every predictor model will possess a minimum error rate, known as the [Bayes Error Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_error_rate). So, usually its a trade-off between these two measures, depending on the domain of the problem. For instance, if we are building a model that predicts if a person is going to test positive for a virus or not, we would prefer if the model had high sensitivity as compared to high specificity because identifying the people that are positive for a virus would be a far more important task. In this case, we would not mind if our model predicts positive for a person who is actually negative for that virus with a reasonable error in exchange for some gain in sensitivity!\n",
